  <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6" id="div1"><h3 id="h3_1">Chicken</h3><p>Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was a pioneering British computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>
